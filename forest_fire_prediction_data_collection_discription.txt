This Python script utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the geemap library to retrieve and analyze satellite imagery data, specifically focusing on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), precipitation, and wind speed for a specified region. The script begins by initializing Google Earth Engine, extracting mean NDVI, LST, precipitation, and wind speed data for a specific date range, and then clipping these datasets to a predefined region represented by a district boundary. Visualization parameters are set for each layer. An interactive map is created using geemap, and the NDVI, LST, precipitation, and wind speed layers are added to it. The script also combines these layers into a single image for input to a machine learning model. Latitude and longitude points are sampled from a CSV file, and corresponding NDVI, LST, precipitation, and wind speed values are extracted for each point. The resulting data is organized into a DataFrame, which is then saved as a CSV file. The script concludes by printing a success message. Overall, this script demonstrates the integration of satellite imagery and geospatial data analysis using Google Earth Engine and Python.
